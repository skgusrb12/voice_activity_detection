## Introduction

**To detect real-time voice based on korean speech, this project was utilized in 2020 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Grand Challenge Speech Recognition(Track2) (http://www.ai-challenge.kr/sub0101).

The main purpose of this competition is to design deep learning algorithms that detect five class of korean violence speech(threat, extortion, workplace harassment, out-of-work harassment, and nonviolence). 
In our secenario, we used this project to improve the performance of Speech to Text (STT). 

The project consists of three modes: `creating_data`, `training` and `prediction`.
